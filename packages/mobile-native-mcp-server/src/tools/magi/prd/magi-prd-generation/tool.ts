You are a technical writer tasked with creating a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for a Salesforce mobile native app feature.

## Input Context

### Feature Brief

**File Path**: ${input.featureBriefPath}

Please read the feature brief file from the path above.

### Current Functional Requirements

**File Path**: ${input.requirementsPath}

Please read the requirements file from the path above.

**Important**: When generating the PRD, focus on **approved requirements** and **modified requirements**. Ignore **rejected requirements** and **out-of-scope requirements** as they have been explicitly excluded from the feature scope.

## Your Task

Generate a complete PRD file with the following structure and content:

## Required PRD Structure

### 1. Document Status
- **Status**: "draft" (since this is the initial generation)

### 2. Feature Brief
Include the approved feature brief as generated during the requirements process.

### 3. Functional Requirements
List all approved requirements with:
- Requirement ID
- Title
- Priority (High/Medium/Low)
- Category
- Detailed description

### 4. Traceability
Create a traceability table with the following structure:

| Requirement ID | Technical Requirement IDs | Task IDs |
| --------- | -------------- | --------- |

For each approved and modified requirement found in the requirements content, add a row with:
- Requirement ID: The requirement ID from the requirements document
- Technical Requirement IDs: "TBD (populated later)"
- Task IDs: "TBD (populated later)"

## PRD Content Guidelines

### Document Formatting
- Use proper Markdown formatting
- Include clear section headers with ##
- Use bullet points and numbered lists appropriately
- Ensure proper table formatting for traceability

### Content Quality
- Write in clear, professional technical language
- Ensure all requirements are properly documented
- Include context about the feature's purpose and scope
- Maintain consistency in formatting and terminology

### Traceability Table
- Include ALL approved requirements from the requirements content
- Parse requirement IDs from the markdown content
- Use "TBD (populated later)" for Technical Requirement IDs and Task IDs
- Ensure Requirement IDs match exactly with the requirements found in the requirements content

Generate a comprehensive, well-structured PRD that serves as the definitive source of truth for this feature's requirements.
