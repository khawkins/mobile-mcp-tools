# `@salesforce/mobile-web-mcp-server` \- Project Design

# Overview

The `@salesforce/mobile-web-mcp-server` is the flagship MCP server within the `mobile-mcp-tools` monorepo, designed to provide comprehensive tooling support for Salesforce Mobile Web development scenarios. This server hosts multiple tool suites, each targeting specific mobile web development use cases.

The server is architected to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new tool suites as mobile web development needs evolve within the Salesforce ecosystem.

# High-Level Project Design

* The `@salesforce/mobile-web-mcp-server` MCP server exposes tools that provide additional expert grounding to user prompts crafted to create Lightning web components for mobile web scenarios.
* The grounding context provided by each server tool varies by tool suite—some tools provide TypeScript declaration content, others provide design patterns, best practices documentation, or other relevant guidance specific to their functional domain.
* The provided grounding context is _entirely static and public in nature_. There is _no_ user-specific or authenticated context required by these MCP tools. Their job is to simply provide the appropriate guidance to the original request, which significantly increases the accuracy of the generated components.

## Key Design Principles

### Tool Types and Capabilities

The server hosts different types of MCP tools depending on their functional domain:

**Information-Only Tools** (e.g., Native Capabilities)

- Supply grounding context to requesting MCP clients
- Expose TypeScript types and APIs available to the client
- Enable informed code completion, validation, and discovery of mobile capabilities

**Analysis and Guidance Tools** (e.g., Mobile Offline)

- Provide code review and refactoring guidance
- Support both purely agentic and static analysis approaches:
  - _Purely agentic_: Provide instructions on anti-patterns to detect and refactoring strategies, with no input required
  - _Static analysis + agentic refactor_: Accept LWC component code as input, run ESLint static analysis rules to detect offline anti-patterns, and return detailed reviews with refactoring instructions

### Modular Tool Organization

Tools are organized into logical suites based on functional domains:

- **Mobile Native Capabilities** - Tools for integrating device capabilities, sourced from `@salesforce/lightning-types`
- **Mobile Offline** - Tools for implementing offline-first design patterns, sourced from documentation and best practices
- **Future Tool Suites** - Extensible architecture supports additional mobile web development scenarios with appropriate source materials

### Consistent Naming Convention

To ensure clear differentiation from other Salesforce MCP server tools while maintaining concise names for MCP client compatibility, all tools use the `sfmobile-web-{capability}` naming pattern:

- Native capabilities: `sfmobile-web-{capability}` (e.g., `sfmobile-web-barcode-scanner`)
- Mobile offline: `sfmobile-web-offline-{analysis-type}` (two orchestrated tools: `sfmobile-web-offline-guidance` and `sfmobile-web-offline-analysis`)

This approach balances tool discoverability with practical MCP client limitations, while optimizing for an MCP host's capacity for just-in-time inclusion of tools for specific use cases.

# System Flow

The following sequence diagram shows the general flow between the user, MCP host (such as A4D or other community MCP hosts), and `@salesforce/mobile-web-mcp-server` MCP tools. This example models a typical interaction pattern that applies to both Information-Only tools (like Native Capabilities) and Analysis and Guidance tools (like Mobile Offline), with each tool suite providing its own domain-specific grounding context.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant MCPHost
    participant MCPClient
    participant MCPTool
    participant LLM

    User->>MCPHost: Creates prompt for mobile LWC development
    MCPHost->>MCPHost: Examines prompt for mobile context needs
    MCPHost->>MCPClient: Forwards user prompt
    MCPClient->>MCPTool: Sends prompt to appropriate mobile tool
    MCPTool-->>MCPClient: Returns grounding context (API declarations, patterns, or analysis)
    MCPClient-->>MCPHost: Returns domain-specific grounding context
    MCPHost->>MCPHost: Combines original prompt with grounding context
    MCPHost->>LLM: Sends fully grounded prompt
    LLM-->>MCPHost: Returns enhanced component content
    MCPHost-->>User: Presents completed mobile-optimized component
```

**Tool Suite Variations:**

- **Native Capabilities tools** return TypeScript API declarations for specific device capabilities
- **Mobile Offline tools** return discrete violation detection instructions (agentic) and comprehensive analysis reviews (static) with specific remediation guidance
- **Future tool suites** will follow this same pattern with their own domain-specific grounding materials

# MCP Client Integration and Transport

The server is designed for maximum compatibility across the MCP ecosystem by adhering to established Model Context Protocol standards:

* **npx Invocation:** The project is designed to be easily targeted and invoked by any MCP client using the standardized `npx` approach. For example, clients can launch the server with a command such as:

```
npx -y @salesforce/mobile-web-mcp-server
```

This ensures a frictionless, installation-free experience for developers and tools integrating with the MCP server, regardless of their chosen MCP host.

* **StdioServerTransport Communication:** Communication between the MCP server and clients uses the `stdio` transport mechanism, as described in the [Model Context Protocol documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports). This transport leverages standard input/output streams and is the recommended approach for command-line and local tool scenarios, ensuring broad compatibility across MCP implementations.

**Name:** `sfdc-mobile-web-mcp-server`  
**Description:** The `sfdc-mobile-web-mcp-server` MCP server provides a comprehensive collection of tools that enable developers to create Lightning web components (LWCs) for mobile web scenarios. Tool suites provide expert grounding through various sources including TypeScript declaration files, design patterns, best practices documentation, and other relevant materials specific to each functional domain.

## Common Server Tool Annotations

_See [Tool Annotations](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools#tool-annotations) in the Model Context Protocol User Guide_

All tools include a `title` annotation using the human-readable title specified in their respective tool suite documentation. The following additional server tool annotations are applied based on tool type:

**Information-Only Tools (e.g., Native Capabilities):**

| Annotation        | Value   | Notes                                                                                        |
| :---------------- | :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `readOnlyHint`    | `true`  | Static content does not modify its environment, and returns the same value for each request. |
| `destructiveHint` | `false` | No modifications occur as part of these tools.                                               |
| `idempotentHint`  | `true`  | No changes from calling these tools repeatedly.                                              |
| `openWorldHint`   | `false` | These tools have no requirement to interact with external entities.                          |

**Analysis and Guidance Tools (e.g., Mobile Offline):**

| Annotation        | Value   | Notes                                                                                               |
| :---------------- | :------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `readOnlyHint`    | `true`  | Tools analyze input without modifying it, returning consistent analysis results for the same input. |
| `destructiveHint` | `false` | No modifications occur, but analysis is performed on provided code.                                 |
| `idempotentHint`  | `true`  | Same input will produce consistent analysis results.                                                |
| `openWorldHint`   | `false` | These tools operate on provided input without external dependencies.                                |
